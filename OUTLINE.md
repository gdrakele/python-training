# Introduction

- Purpose

    - Introducing Python as a technology
    
    - Improving skill with Python

- Focus / What this talk is for

    - Very minor syntax

    - BKMs

    - Tooling

    - Differences from other common languages

    - Common gotchas

    - Deep dive / more advanced?

- What this talk is not for

    - Teaching programming - assumed audience already programs

    - Python 101

# Python as a Technology

- Scripting to Applications

- Python is "doing high level things in C"

- Slow, but fast

    - "Glue" for low level libraries

    - Improved ergonomics

- The Zen of Python

# Syntax

- Simple, less "character noise"

- Whitespace is significant

- Newlines end statements, backslash is inverted semicolon ("not end of statement")

# BKMs

- Multi-paradigm

- Comprehensions

- Context managers

- Use the ecosystem

# Tooling

- Code Formatting - Black

- Static Type Checking - MyPy

- Testing - Pytest

- Import Sorting - ISort

# Differences from other common languages

- Variable Scope

- Globals / Nonlocals

# Common gotchas

- Mutable default values for parameters

# Deep dive / more advanced?

TBD
